    Concepts and helpful comands when using Python/Visual Studio:

    VS Command Palette: ctrl + shift + P 
    The command palette lets you search and run any of the commands available within VS Code. If you don’t know how to do something, the command palette will usually point you in the right direction.
    The command palette is how you’ll navigate VS Code.

    VS Quick Open, Go to File: ctrl + P
    Quick open is how you’ll navigate your codebase and files.
    To dismiss either dialog, press the Escape key.

    Virtual Environment: Self-contained installation of a python version in the libraries inside a project to avoid using multiple versions and getting errors. (env\scripts\activate)

    REPL: Read-Eval-Print-Loop, is an interactive programming environmetn that allows to type in python (in this case) expressiones and get instant results. (Python: Start REPL).

    Important Methods for Python REPL:

        type(variable) //Returns the type of a variable.

        dir(variable) //Returns a directory of every method available for the specific type of the variable inside.

        help(type) or help(str.method) //Returns a list that explains every method available for the type used/for the method used. (press Q to cancel)

    PEP8: The standard style guide followed by python.

    Run Python File on VS: Python: Run Pyhton File in Terminal from command palette.
